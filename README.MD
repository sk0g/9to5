# What is 9to5?
An Android project, undertaken for a client wanting a phone app built for their quiz. The quiz consists of 2 banks of 20 questions, and a result is shown after each set of questions. After the second result is shown, the final result screen comments on the overall work-life satisfaction of the user undertaking the quiz, in greater detail.  

The project was undertaken while studying at Griffith University. More specifically, for the Work Integrated Learning module.

The app is mainly written in Java, but the SaveCode file is written in Kotlin. If I was starting from scratch, the whole app would be written in Kotlin, due to how easy to use it turned out to be.
### Notes
strings.xml has been removed in order to protect the IP of the client. 
Without this, the app will not compile.

If I had more time to work on the project, I would have read up on other layout methods, as I'm aware the current quiz question layouts are far from efficient, or ideal.
